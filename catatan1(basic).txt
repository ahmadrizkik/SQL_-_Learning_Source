        # CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE
        #######===========#######

database in sqlite made of table fill with rows and column 
access using cmd with command
 > C:\Users\Rizky>sqlite3 (database_name.db)
If theres no file with that name, it will make a new file

make a new table with VARCHAR type, data type must input in the beginning
 > CREATE TABLE table_name(rowid, name VARCHAR(25), email VARCHAR(35));
use this to make unique data type
 > PRIMARY KEY
want data prohibited to insert if empty
 > NOT NULL
data is just number
 > INT


        #######===========#######
        ###==== Catatan 3 ====###
        # INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
        #######===========#######

insert into untuk memasukkan data ke table
 > INSERT INTO table_name(rowid, name, email) VALUES(1, 'alpha',
   'alpha@skdj.osdf');

update untuk mengubah data yang ada
 > UPDATE table_name SET name='omega' WHERE rowid = 1;

delete data yang ada
 > DELETE FROM table_name WHERE rowid = 2;

Delete table with command
> DROP TABLE table_name;


        #######===========#######
        ###==== Catatan 4 ====###
        # SELECT, WHERE, LIKE
        #######===========#######

print data dengan
 > SELECT * FROM table_name;

select for specific column
 > SELECT column_name,column_name FROM table_name;

using WHERE for conditional
 > SELECT column_name/* FROM table_name WHERE column_name > 30;
 > other operator can be used like =, >=, <=

using LIKE for more detail conditional
 > SELECT column_name/* FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE
   "&keyword&"
 > & = is to determined if theres a character before or after keyword
   exp = "%keyword", "keyword&", "%keyword%".
 > _ = is to determined if theres single character before or after 
   keyword
   exp = "_keyword", "keyword__", "___keyword___"
Another Wildcard character 
 > [abc] = represent single character inside
 > [^abc] = represent single character not inside
 > [a-z] = represent single character from inside


        #######===========#######
        ###==== Catatan 5 ====###
        # LIMIT, ORDER, DISTINCT
        #######===========#######


show only specific row using LIMIT
 > SELECT column_name/* FROM table_name LIMIT 2;
to make it to page, add OFFSET
 > SELECT column_name/* FROM table_name LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2;

order table using ORDER BY
 > SELECT column_name/* FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;
add another column_name to double order
 > SELECT column_name/* FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name1,
   column_name2;
use DESC to make it descending
 > SELECT column_name/* FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name DESC;

select with only difference value
 > SELECT DISTINCT column_name/* FROM table_name;

        #######===========#######
        ###==== Catatan 6 ====###
        # AND, OR, NOT
        #######===========#######

use AND if has to be TRUE at all condition
 > SELECT * FROM table_name
   WHERE column_name="data_in_table" AND column_name2="data_in_table";
use OR if has to be TRUE at any condition
 > SELECT * FROM table_name
   WHERE column_name="data_in_table" OR column_name1=
   "other_data_in_table";
use NOT if want to exclude
 > SELECT * FROM table_name
   WHERE NOT column_name="data_in_table"
all of it can be combined
 > SELECT * FROM Customers
   WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City='Berlin' OR City='MÃ¼nchen');


        #######===========#######
        ###==== Catatan 7 ====###
        # MIN, MAX, COUNT, AVG, SUM
        #######===========######

MIN and MAX
 > SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;
 > SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;
COUNT to count rows
 > SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;
AVG to count average INT value
 > SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;
SUM to add all INT value
 > SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;


        #######===========#######
        ###==== Catatan 8 ====###
        # SELECT TOP, IN, BETWEEN, AS, JOIN
        #######===========#######

to select top of table, it can be combined with WHERE
 > SELECT TOP 3 * FROM table_name:
 in MySQL
 > SELET * FROM table_name LIMIT 3;

IN is shorthand for OR command
 > SELECT * FROM table_name
   WHERE column_name IN (column_value1, column_value2)

BETWEEN to select in range
 > SELECT * FROM table_name
   WHERE column_name BETWEEN 10 AND 30;
 > SELECT * FROM table_name
   WHERE column_name BETWEEN "Alpha" AND "Zeta";
 > SELECT * FROM table_name
   WHERE column_name BETWEEN '1996-07-01' AND '1996-07-31';

AS for Aliases but only in that query
 > SELECT column_name AS new1;
 > SELECT a.column_name FROM table_name AS a;

JOIN to merge two table into one, add ON in equivalent
INNER JOIN to join same column_type
 > SELECT *
   FROM table_name INNER JOIN table_name1
   ON table_name.column_name = table_name1.column_name1
 > SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
   FROM Customers INNER JOIN Orders
   ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
LEFT JOIN for full table in left
RIGHT JOIN for full table in right,
FULL JOIN for join all table
